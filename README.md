For first Code Academy assignment, the mini game!

Requirements listed in "requirements.txt", can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For now empty, no special requirements.

Launced by function main(), by entering `python frst_assignment.py`

played directly in terminal window, closes autmaticaly on win/lose.

Future plans:
    * Create game modes - Player vs player, ai vs ai.
    * Sepparate "game engine" and AI 
    * Create classes for Player and AI
    * Make AI smarter.
